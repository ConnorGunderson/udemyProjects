DISCLAIMER

I formatted my pc and didnt push my data to github beforehand so lectures preceeding 16 are gone. Those modules gave insight on bootstrap as well as touch up on code etiquette and basic front end languages.

Modules that are skipped had no importance or stuff I was already comfortable learning (command line interface, stdin/out/piping, IDE's, setting up depreciated technologies)
